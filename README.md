# City Events Map Prototype

## Introduction

This repo provides a series of lessons designed to bring a developer, already
familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, up to speed with
the React / Redux framework.

The output of this effort will be a web application that uses an
API of city events (fake API is internally provided) to render a
map showing city events filtered by time and location.

The final solution is provided at:

http://city-events-map-prototype.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

// TODO: REMOVE DISCLAIMER WHEN DONE

Disclaimer, the final solution is a work in progress; expected to be
complete during the week of Nov. 14, 2016.

This repo is organized into a series of lessons; one per branch (each
with its own README file). The remaining files in the branch provide
the final result of the lesson.

To continue to the first lesson, select the branch named *lesson_1*.

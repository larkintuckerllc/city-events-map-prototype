## Lesson 12

This is one lesson in a series designed to bring a developer, already
familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, up to speed with
the React / Redux framework. An introduction and instructions on using
these lessons are provided in the README of the *master* branch of this
repository.

Now that we have control of our build process (with Webpack),
we can follow the instructions and install Bootstrap with
Bootstrap-Loader.

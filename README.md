# City Events Map Prototype

## Lesson 1

This is one lesson in a series designed to bring a developer, already
familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, up to speed with
the React / Redux framework. An introduction and instructions on using
these lessons are provided in the README of the *master* branch of this
repository.

Before continuing, it is important to understand the theory (in particular,
the why) behind the React / Redux framework. Without an appreciation of
the problem that this framework seeks to solve, one will undoubtedly
find it overly complicated.

Facebook provides an excellent video introduction to React and Flux;
Redux is a particular implementation of the Flux architecture.

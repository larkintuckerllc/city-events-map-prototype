# City Events Map Prototype

## Lesson 2

This is one lesson in a series designed to bring a developer, already
familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, up to speed with
the React / Redux framework. An introduction and instructions on using
these lessons are provided in the README of the *master* branch of this
repository.

As this application relies on the Google Maps JavaScript API, it is
helpful to have a basic understanding of its use outside of the
React / Redux framework.

**Assignment (1 Hour): Implement the Google Maps demo provide at:**

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map

**note:** Use a text editor of your choice for this exercise, e.g.,
*Notepad* on Windows or *TextEdit* on OS X. While one can complete this
series with these text editors, one of the lessons will be to install
and configure a more powerful editor.

**note:** If you want, you can use the following API key for your demo.
Do not use this API key outside of this series of lessons as it may be
revoked at any time.

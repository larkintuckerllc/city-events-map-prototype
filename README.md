# City Events Map Prototype

## Lesson 10

This is one lesson in a series designed to bring a developer, already
familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, up to speed with
the React / Redux framework. An introduction and instructions on using
these lessons are provided in the README of the *master* branch of this
repository.

In the previous lesson, we used a third-party slider component which
had limitations (styling). Turns out that there is a HTML5 range
input that (with a bit of CSS) can be styled.

**note:** While this input is not supported on IE9; most organizations
that are stuck on older versions of IE provide their employees access
to updated browsers, e.g., FireFox or Chrome.
